* before run 'std_MAIN.m' *
---------------------------

Please do the following (make your own note if anything is missing here):

1. install EEGLab v13_5_4b (recommeded not to save in toolbox, but in 'my documents')
2. install ERPLab v5.0.0.0 (save in EEGLab 'plugins' folder)
3. install BIOSIG (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Plugins, save in EEGLab 'plugins' folder)
4. have the following 4 files ready in a  folder: 
	- 'bdf.txt', 
	- 'biosemi64xyz10-20.xyz', 
	- 'erpfiles.txt', 
	- 'garvparm.txt'
5. have raw EEG data (.bdf) ready in a folder.
6. save all the scripts into one folder.
7. modify the directory/expname to yours in the following function (prefix is omitted here):
	- 'MAIN.m'
	- 'flags.m'
	- 'paraset.m'
	- 'import.m'
	- 'artif.CreateFiles.m'
	- in  the file 'erpfiles.txt'.
8. set up values in 'std_flags.m'and 'std_paraset.m' for the following stages:
	- stage 1 
		-- set 'clr' = 1;
		-- set flags in stage 1 equal to '1';
		-- leave the rest of flags equal to '0'
		-- run 'MAIN.m'
        - stage 2 <before artifact detection> : 
		-- change 'clr'= 0. ** Important ** 
		-- modify auto-generated artif function for each subjects based ** Important ** 
		-- set flags at stage 2 equal to '1'
		-- run 'MAIN.m again


------------------------
* After run std_MAIN.m *
------------------------

it will:

1. clear the Workspace, clear the screen, display 'Setting up...'
2. Save Command Window output text to a created file specified by you (see MAIN.m)
3. According to the flags set by you to run selected functions
4. Choose the operating systems set by you to do the following (if it is Windows): 

	- auto create 5 folders: 'CMD', 'EEG-DATA', 'EEG-ANAL', 'Measure', 'Grand', to the specified path
	- auto copy 3 files from source folder to 'CMD' folder
	- auto create erpfiles.txt to to 'CMD' folder
	- auto copy raw .bdf data to EEG-DATA foler
	- auto create subfolders for each subject in 'EEG-ANAL'
   	- auto create std_artif_S* (artifact detection function) for each subject for you to modify manually
        - auto call the std_artif_s* for each subject after your modification
5. auto save all the steps into subfolder 'EEG-ANAL' for each subject 
6. simplify the original program in the way that repeatedly used variables in functions are set to be global and only need to modify once.
7. after each functions, a suffix will be added to the saved file names as the following:
	- 'e' for elist
	- 'b' for blins
	- 'c' for chanloc
	- 'p' for epoch
	- 'y' for addeye
	- 'a' for artif
	- 'M12' for eegrefch
	- 'M12.erp' for erprefch
	- 'CAR' for common reference
-----------
*   AoB   *
-----------
- suffix in epoch.m is changed from 'e' to 'p' due to the same as in 'elist.m'
- It will take more than 8 hours to run the whole batch of Color data when error free.
- if apply the script on other dataset, replace all 'std' by your 'expname', e.g. 'color'
- original RTlock & CAR removed
- CAR added to erprefch.m
