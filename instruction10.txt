---------------------------
* before run 'std_MAIN.m' *
---------------------------

Please do the following (make your own note if anything is missing here):

1. install EEGLab v13_6_5b (recommed not to save in toolbox, but in 'my documents')
2. install ERPLab v5.1.1.0 (save in EEGLab 'plugins' folder)
3. install BIOSIG v3.0.7 (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Plugins, save in EEGLab 'plugins')
4. have the following 3 files ready in a  folder named '3Files': 
	- 'bdf.txt', 
	- 'biosemi64xyz10-20.xyz',  
	- 'garvparm.txt'
5. have the file 'biosemi64xyz10-20.xyz' ready
5. download and save all the scripts into one folder (e.g. standard10).
6. have raw EEG data (.bdf) ready somewhere. 
7. modifications are needed as the following (prefix is omitted here):
	- in 'MAIN.m' :(1) the dir and (2) the name of 'diary' (3) addpath(genpath()
	- in 'flags.m':  (1) 'expname'   (2) 'pathname_all' (*very important to keep the last '\') (3) 'pathname_raw'(*very important to keep the last '\')
	- in 'paraset.m': (1) expression
	- in 'artif.CreateFiles.m': (1) 'fidIn'
8. set up all values in 'flag.m' (please see the instruction in flag.m)
         
------------------------
* After run std_MAIN.m *
------------------------

it will:

1. clear the Workspace, clear the screen, display 'Setting up...'
2. Save Command Window output text to a created file specified by you (see MAIN.m)
3. According to the flags set by you to run selected functions

if os is Windows, automatically do the following:   
- create 7 folders: 'CMD', 'EEG-ANAL', 'Measure', 'Grand', 'BEH-ANAL', 'RT', 'BLO' to the specified path
- copy 3 files from source folder to 'CMD' folder
- create erpfiles.txt to  'CMD' folder
- optional to copy raw .bdf data to EEG-DATA-COPY foler
- Read list of raw files from raw file directory, and sort the order
- create subfolders for each subject in 'EEG-ANAL', and import the raw data.
- create std_artif_S* (artifact detection function) for each subject, then you can modify manually
- call the std_artif_s* for each subject after your modification
- save all steps into subfolder 'EEG-ANAL' for each subject
- save the RT output files (.txt & .xls) in '.../BEH-ANAL/RT'
- save the blinister .txt output files in '.../BEH-ANAL/BLO'
- optional to Common average reference (CAR)

3. simplify the original program in the way that repeatedly used variables in functions are set to be global and only need to modify once.
4. after each function, a suffix will be added to the saved file names as the following:
	- 'e' for elist
	- 'b' for blins
	- 'c' for chanloc
	- 'p' for epoch
	- 'y' for addeye
	- 'a' for artif
	- 'aM' for eegrefch (default reference is average of left mastoid [M1] and right mastoid [M2])
	- 'ca' for common average reference (for EEGs)

	- '_ar' for reject the artifacts (for ERPs)
	- '_al' for all trials (for ERPs)
	- '_ba' for bad trials with artifacts (for ERPs)
	- '_ae' for reject artifacts and EFFT (for ERPs)

	- 'mM' for erprefch, reference to mean of M1 and M2 (mean mastoids); note, aM = mM (never do both)
	- 'CA`' for common average reference (for ERPs); note, ca = CA, never do both

-----------
*   AoB   *
-----------

- suffix in epoch.m is changed from 'e' to 'p' due to the same as in 'elist.m'
- It will take more than 8 hours to run the whole batch of Color data when error free.
- if apply the script on other dataset, replace all 'std' by your 'expname', e.g. 'color'
- original RTlock is removed
- occasionally 'importing' function is not working properly when reading raw EEG data into .fdt and .set format. The size of the generated file is much smaller than it should be. Then you will get error message when executing 'elist'.
