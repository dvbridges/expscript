Plan And History

expscript

TO DO (in order of priority):
* Channel interpolation option before reref (will need to run script first for garv then 2nd time for interpolation/NaNs from interpolation onwards): (a) none (default), (b) interpolation spherical spline, (c) NaNs and use matlab nanmean function during group-level analyses or similar EEGLab/ERPLab solution.
* Run using Parameter file with options for flags, function parameters: flags, # chans, CAR, exp name, raw file list, windows/linux, RTlock, lrp.
* 32 channel option
* Common average reference (CAR) option
* ERPLab Measure: parameter option to choose bins and channels
* EEG spectra at ERPLab averaging step (does not work in matlab2015b with EEGLab 13.5.4b with ERPLab 5)
* EEGLab artefact detection
* ICA for artefact detection
* RTlock option
* LRP option
* Best order for steps: reref
* Enable steps to be done in different order
* Windows vs. linux options
* ANOVA after ERP measure http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/analysis-of-variance-anova-1.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop
* User friendly
